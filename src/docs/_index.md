When you access your websites configuration and editor it can look overwhelming at first, but it is actually really easy to use once you understand the basics of how it all works.

## Dashboard

The dashboard is what you will first see when you load into your websites editor. You'll see some basic information including:

* A preview of your website on how it look on a computer and mobile phone
* Left hand side navigation to your websites pages and data
* Recent activity
* Basic actions

You can always access these guides again by clicking on the "?" in the left hand side navigation.

Overall you won't be spending much time on the dashboard. Lets move onto what you are here for, creating and updating pages!

## Creating pages

Creating pages is as easy as clicking button! Once you are in the pages section of your website (you get here by clicking on the "Pages" in the left hand navigation) you can start creating new pages.

The "Services" pages and "Blog" pages are created the same. They are separated compared to normal pages because they work differently under the hood. Refer to "Services" and "Blogging" guides for more information.

### Creating Folders

As your business grows your website is likely to grow with it. To help keep your website organized you can create folders to place your pages into. You create a folder the same way you create a page.

## Editing your pages

Once you create a new page, or are going to update an existing page, you'll be greeted with the page editor (you can learn more about the options and what they do in the page editing guide)

The page editor can feel overwhelming so lets break it down.

### Page editor

The page editor has two modes, split screen and full screen. You can toggle between each mode by clicking on the bottom left icon of the page editor.
