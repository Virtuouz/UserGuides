## Page options

### Draft

This should be self explanatory. If this is checked it your page will be considered in draft mode and will not show up in your live site.

Unfortunately, draft pages do not have access to the live editor. A page must be non draft and saved for the live editor to show up for that page. If you want to live edit your page, but don't want people to find it, you can use the "Remove from navigation" option (more on this later.

All newly created pages will have draft mode check. Don't forget to uncheck the box before saving once you are ready to publish your page.
