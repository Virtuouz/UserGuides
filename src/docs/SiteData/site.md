This file is where you will set up your main website configuration. Lets go into each option

The logo image to be used on the top left part of the navigation and in the footer. See the images below for examples

**Top navigation:**

**Footer:**

If you have no logo yet, that is fine! You can leave this blank and your business Name will be used instead.

## Name

This is where you business name goes. This could be your legal name, a shortened version of your business name that your community knows you by, or a legal doing business as name.

This name will be used instead of a logo if you don't provide a logo.

## Legal Name

Now here is where you full legal name should be placed. This only used as needed on the website. The most obvious example of this being used is the copyright notice at the bottom of the website.

## URL

This is where you will place your websites live link. This piece of information is primarily used for creating your sitemap. A sitemap is how google finds the pages on your website and thus it is crucial that this be your real website URL (website link)
