Your websites colors and fonts are set up here.

## Colors Groups

We use what we call Color Groups. These are exactly what they sound like. They are group of colors that will be used on your website. You might be familiar with this concept as other website builders might call it your color scheme or theme. We don't call it theme because there isn't a single color group that governs the entire site. You could use all of the groups of colors across your website and that is why we call them color groups.

Color groups consist of 5 colors:

* Text
* Background
* Primary
* Secondary
* Accent

### Primary Color Group

As the name suggests, this is the primary color group that will be used for your website. The primary color group is the default group that is used for any section you add to a page. While you can change the name of the primary Color Group, it will be the primary and still the default used for sections.

### Custom Color Groups

Custom Color Groups is where you will add any additional color schemes. This will be available to use in all places that make use of color groups.

A common use case for an additional custom color group besides the primary would be to set up a dark theme color scheme of your primary colors or vice versa.

ðŸ’¡**NOTE:<br>**Custom Color Groups cannot be set as the primary color group. You will need to modify the primary color group colors if you want to update the primary group colors.
