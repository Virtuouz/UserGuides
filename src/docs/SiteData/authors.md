The Authors file is fairly straight forward. This is where you will create or remove authors. These authors are used in combination with blog posts. Every blog post should have an author and you can set those up here.

Each author can be given a name an da picture of the author. If it is an entity that is not a single person (such as company) you can use the name of the company and their logo instead.
