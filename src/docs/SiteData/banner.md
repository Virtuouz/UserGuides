The banner Data file controls your websites notification banner. This is great way to quickly add a website wide notification.

Examples of when you might want to use a the banner:

* Promotion offering a discount for a certain time
* New service or product being offered
* Let people know of upcoming event
* Notify that you are at fully booked

## Options

### Enable Banner

This one does exactly what it sounds like. This will enable or disable the banner on your website. If disabled, all other banner options are hidden

### Banner Content

This is where you plan what you want to say in your notification banner.

Whatever you place here, be sure to try and make it short. If you are finding yourself writing out multiple sentences, there is a better way. Create a normal page to talk about the notification and exclude it from your navigation. Then once you have built out that page you can link to it from your banner. There are many other options, but this is just one of them for handling lots of text in your banner.

### Unique ID

Every banner needs an ID. Just like it sounds, this is the ID of the banner that makes it one banner different from another, even if the content is the same. This ID used to track if someone has closed out the banner or not. If someone has chosen to close out the notification banner, it won't be shown to them again on that device.

Our suggestion of what to set as your ID is to use the date the banner was created followed by a 1-3 word summary of what the banner is talking about.

Examples:

* 2024-07-16-discount
* 20240716NewProduct
* Event-2024-7-16

Use the examples above to help you come up with a system that works best for you and your business.

### Show Until

Here you can set until what day you the banner should no longer be shown to people.

If you feel like you are in a situation in which you would like to have a permanent banner, please send us a message and we'll guide you in the direction that makes the most sense for your use case.

### Color Group

Select which color group to use from the colors groups you have set up in the Theme. Whatever color group you select in this field will the determine the colors available for the next field

### Color From Group

The color that choose from here will be used as the background color for the notification banner.

You don't need to worry about the text being readable with certain colors, that is handled automatically.
