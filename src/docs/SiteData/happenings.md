## Image and Alt text

This is where you set up the configuration for your happenings. You can set your default image for any happenings that don't have one, and the associated Alt text for that image.

## Tags

This is where you set up tags that you want to be considered "happening" tags. Only these tags will feed into the happening components.

**NOTE:**<br>This field is directly fed by the tags set up in the "Blog Tags" data file. Make sure you have set up your tags in that file first (and saved them) to have them as available options here.
