![](/assets/images/uploads/image-81.png)

To embed a video you'll need to the know the video's id of the platform that you are looking for. You can find this by looking at the URL of the platform when you have that video selected.

### Youtube

For youtube, the video id is the text found after the "?v=" For example, if the link to a youtube video is "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwpdKxNf-V8" the ID of this video would be "TwpdKxNf-V8" and that is what you would copy into the "Video ID" field of the snippet

### Vimeo

You can find the ID for you Vimeo video in multiple places. If you have your Vimeo video opened up in your dashboard, the video ID would be the numbers at the end of the URL.

For example if the URL at the top of the website is "https://vimeo.com/manage/videos/1025941874" the video ID would be "1025941874"

It is very similar if instead you have a share link of a Vimeo video. For example if your Vimeo video share link is "https://vimeo.com/1025941874?share=copy#t=0" then the ID of your video is still "1025941874"
