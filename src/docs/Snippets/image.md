This image snippet allows you to create optimized images (the best quality for the lowest space = fast websites) with the added functionality of letting your website visitors click the image and see the full image in a bigger view!

Example of a image being opened into bigger view after being clicked

![](/assets/images/uploads/image-60.png)

## Using the image snippet

After you have inserted your snippet (read the "What is a snippet?" to see how to do this) all you have to do is select the image and set the alt text for the image

![](/assets/images/uploads/image-62.png)

That's it! Quick and easy to use.
