Welcome to the guides! Here you'll find information to help you understand how to edit your website what each website component does, and best practices for websites.

These guides should be used as a resource. We don't expect you read every single guide before you start editing your website, nor do we want you to. These guides should be used as a tool that refer to as you need it. Just like how you pull out the hammer to put in nails, and put it away when you are done. Treat these guides the same way.

The only guide that you should read before you start editing your website is the "Getting Started" it will teach you the basics and get you website editing ready!
